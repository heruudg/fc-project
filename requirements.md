make a simple app using react/vite maybe, to calculate estimation of how much litre fuel needed by calculating total km / km per liter
use tailwind so its easier to handle responsive
form will be 
- km A
- km B
- vehicle type (for starting, there is 2 type, engkel n traga, please create json so i can configure km per liter)
- when user click calculate button, the app will calculate fuel consumtion by total km (km b - km a) / km per liter (based on vehicle type)
